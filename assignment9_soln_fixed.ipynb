        "\n",
        "In the previous assignment, we explored how to use a pre-trained model to extract word embeddings and then build a multinomial logistic regression model to predict a firm\u2019s sector membership. We experimented with both bert-base and a domain-specific model. However, we observed that these embeddings did not consistently outperform a simple word count approach \u2014 especially on the test set, where accuracy dropped significantly. This suggests the pre-trained models, without adaptation, may not generalize well to our task.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part, we\u2019ll take the next step and explore **fine-tuning**, which involves training (usually with a small learning rate) all of the model\u2019s parameters for a specific task. This approach is one of the most powerful ways to adapt large language models to downstream tasks, such as classification or question answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Using Colab for GPU Acceleration\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern models like BERT are very large \u2014 for example:\n",
        "\t\u2022\tbert-base has 110 million parameters\n",
        "\t\u2022\tEven DistilBERT has 66 million parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "Training such models is computationally intensive, especially on CPUs. To make this process feasible, we\u2019ll move our work to **Google Colab**, which provides access to **free GPUs** like Tesla T4s.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you begin, here are some important tips to ensure you use it properly:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Make sure your Colab environment is set to use a GPU: Go to Runtime \u2192 Change runtime type \u2192 Hardware accelerator \u2192 T4 GPU\n",
        "\n",
        "- Colab monitors resource usage. If you\u2019re idle for too long, or leave the GPU running without activity, you may lose access or get temporarily banned from using GPU. **Always shut down the kernel when you\u2019re done**: Go to Runtime \u2192 Manage sessions \u2192 Terminate"
